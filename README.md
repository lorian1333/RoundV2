Round MDM Login theme V2
=========

## Overview

Improved version of [Round](https://github.com/koenhendriks/Round). It's coded in HTML, jQuery and CSS3 and uses mdm as screen manager.
It has support for multi language, multi sessions, and multi users. Default system functions like shutting down or restarting are also implemented.

In the middle of the screen are the images of the users. If a user is clicked it will slide to the left revealing the password input. If the user doesn't have a password set it will log in immediately on the click.
Animations are done with CSS3 transitions.

## Features

Currently supports the following:

- Login with or without password
- User profile picture and full name
- Change session
- Change language
- Shutdown/suspend/restart
- Show time and date
- Show error messages
